# Contact Form üìù
A simple contact form I made to practice using form elements in HTML.
# Overview
A form consisting of some input elements like text boxes, radio buttons,
a checkbox, and a dropdown menu.
I experimented with the different attributes of the input elements,
like validation attributes or the value to send with the form submission.
Basic styling has been applied to the form to make it more vibrant and responsive.
This website is just to practice the Front-end aspect of using forms in HTML.
